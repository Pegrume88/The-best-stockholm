## Nature and Culture

For the Nature and culture page I have followed the same disign as the previous food and drinks page. this was done to creat stylistic consistancy. The hero image used was of a person overlooking a lake surround by dense woodland. I chose this image to give a contrast to the drinks and food page and the landing page image.

On this page we have focused and nature and culture. The nature aspects are hiking and kayking and for the cultural aspects we have chosen a few of the most interesting and eye catching museums to visit.
each activity or venue name is a link that take you to the necceressary webpage in a new tab.
